# Description
This data analysis project focuses on extracting insights from the customer data of Bank UK, a financial institution with branches across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Leveraging Tableau for visualization, our analysis includes a geographic map showcasing customer balances, age distribution, balance distribution, and gender percentages.
